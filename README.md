This project shows that I was able to successfully fork a repo from github and bring it into the Glitch environment. After bringing in the project,
I had to first 'npm install mime --save' to bring in mime as a dependency and add it to the package.json. Then I edited the 'server.js' file so that
I could bring in my CSS file. The rest from there was editing the HTML and having fun with the CSS of the page.

## Technical Achievements
- **Animated Title**: Shown in `styles.css`, I was able to use the animation property to animate both my title and my links. When the page is loaded,
the title's letter spacing is animated to come together and the links float.

- **Animated Links**: Shown in `styles.css`, I was able to animate a cool little bar for the links on mouse hover. This makes the page feel more responsive
and taught me more about what CSS is actually capable of. 



### Design Achievements

- **Links traverse page**: Even though this is a small example, the links on the homepage allow you to quickly view the sectioned content making
it easier to traverse the page.
